Your task is to write a Java program in the file CountDown.java 
that compiles and uses all of the tokens listed in Tokens.java
The smaller your program the higher your score.
The size of the program does not include whitespace
so please format the code nicely for the reviews.

Each time you press the [test] button cyber-dojo
  o) sees if CountDown.java compiles
  o) tells your your score
  o) tells you exactly how your score is calculated


SCORING
-------
score = minus the size of CountDown.java
for each token you have used in CountDown.java
  score += 3*token.size 
if (all tokens used in CountDown.java)
  score += 50


RULES
-----
o) You may edit only the file CountDown.java
o) The size of the program does not include whitespace
o) The code is not run (so you do not need a main)
o) The code has to compile 
o) The code may have warnings
o) The code may have extra tokens!
o) Tokens must be whole tokens
   eg you cannot use the keyword double for the do keyword
   eg you cannot use ... for the . operator
o) Keyword tokens must be keywords
   eg you cannot use the string "do" for the do keyword
o) The judges decision is final
