In this cyber-dojo there are three classes which implement
the TennisGame interface. Each is a slightly different
refactoring challenge. The idea is to concentrate on one at
a time.

Start by refactoring TennisGame1. 

Take small steps, run the tests often. You should not
need to change the test cases. If you get a series
of compiler or test errors, consider reverting
back to the latest green test run. (You can easily do this by 
clicking on the latest green traffic light at the top of
the page, and select "revert".)

When you are happy with the design for TennisGame1, try refactoring
the other two versions, one at a time.

Which one was hardest? Which one got the best design in the end?

Summary of tennis scoring:

1. A game is won by the first player to have won at
   least four points in total and at least two points
   more than the opponent.
   
2. The running score of each game is described in a
   manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three
   points are described as "love", "fifteen", "thirty",
   and "forty" respectively.
   
3. If at least three points have been scored by each
   player, and the scores are equal, the score is "deuce".
   
4. If at least three points have been scored by each
   side and a player has one more point than his opponent,
   the score of the game is "advantage" for the player
   in the lead.
